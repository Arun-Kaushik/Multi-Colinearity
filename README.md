Multi-Colinearity
=================
This app shows what happens to multiple regression results when there is considerable covariance between two contiunous predictor variables. Although the overall model fit does not change as the covariance is increased (as visualized by the regression of y onto yhat and the R squared in the model summary), the parameter estimates become unstable and the confidence intervals expand, which yields large p values even though the relationship between the predictors and the response variable does not change.
